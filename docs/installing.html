			<p>Before you do anything with the libraries, you must download the project. If you are an end user you can just download the executables from the latest release artifacts found <a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/acagliano/cryptx/releases/latest">here</a>. Alternatively, you can clone the repository by running the following command in Terminal or Command Prompt:<br /><span class="code">git clone https://github.com/acagliano/cryptx.git</span> and then build the binaries yourself by running `make` from within the `cryptx` folder.</p>
			<div class="major-header">Sending to your Calculator</div>
			<p>Once you have located the binaries you want to install (see above), you will want to connect your calculator to your computer using a USB-A to mini-B cable and use your preferred connectivity software to transfer the binaries to your device. It is recommended to transfer the libraries to Archive if you are given the option to do so.</p>
			<div class="major-header">Installing to the Toolchain (for developers)</div>
			<p>If you are a developer who wants to use CryptX in one of your own projects, it gets a bit more complicated. In order to build as a dynamic library (which is how CryptX is designed) you will need to clone the repository that has the header and lib files:<br />(<span class="code">git clone https://github.com/acagliano/cryptx.git</span>).<br />
				Once you do this you will need to find the <span style="font-family:monospace;">.lib and .h</span> files for each library within the library&apos;s directory (hashlib, encrypt, encodex) and move them into the appropriate directories within the toolchain.
				<table style="width:60%;">
					<col width="30%" />
					<col width="70%" />
					<tr><th>File Extension</th><th>Target Directory</th></tr>
					<tr><td>.h</td><td>&lt;CEdev_root&gt;/include</td></tr>
					<tr><td>.lib</td><td>&lt;CEdev_root&gt;/lib/libload</td></tr>
				</table><br />
				Once this is done, you should be able to include the library headers in your project the same way you would any other C standard library.<br />
				Ex: <span class="code">#include &lt;encrypt.h&gt;</span>
